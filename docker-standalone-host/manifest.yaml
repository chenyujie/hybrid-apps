FullName: io.murano.apps.docker.DockerStandaloneHost
Name: Docker Standalone Host
Description: |
    Standalone docker implementation; employs single VM running docker service.

    Implements DockerHost interface (along with Kubernetes Pod), to unify
    docker hosting solutions, and make docker applications independent
    of one another on hosting platform.

    The Docker service is accessed using CLI client from within the same
    VM, so the docker API is not exposed outside VM.
